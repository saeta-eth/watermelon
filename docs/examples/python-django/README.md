# Django Example

Sandbox configuration for Django web development.

## Setup

```bash
cd your-django-project
cp .watermelon.toml ./
watermelon run
```

## Inside the sandbox

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000 on your host
```

## Database

For local SQLite development, no changes needed - the database file lives in your project.

For PostgreSQL/MySQL in another container:

```toml
[network]
allow = [
    "pypi.org",
    "files.pythonhosted.org",
    # Add your database host if external
]
```

## What's protected

Python packages with native extensions can run arbitrary code during installation. Watermelon ensures that code can't:
- Read your SSH keys or cloud credentials
- Exfiltrate data to unknown servers
- Install persistence mechanisms on your host
